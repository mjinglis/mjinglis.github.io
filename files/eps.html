					<p><i>Abstract:</i> 
					An ability to successfully add numerical digits is a key goal of early mathematics.
But the mechanisms by which adults and children are able to perform such arithmetical
tasks are unclear. There is robust evidence that humans have an inbuilt 'number sense' -
or non-symbolic system - which supports approximate numerical operations. Using a
variety of paradigms it has been shown that the non-symbolic system plays a role when
participants are asked to compare symbolic and non-symbolic numerosities, or to add
non-symbolic numerosities. Recently it has been demonstrated that, prior to formal
instruction, children can harness the non-symbolic system to perform approximate
symbolic arithmetic tasks (Gilmore et al, 2007). Here we report two experiments which
demonstrate that the non-symbolic system also exerts an influence on adult participants'
performances on approximate symbolic addition tasks. In addition we derive and test a
novel prediction from Barth et al.'s (2006) model of the non-symbolic system, by
demonstrating that participants' response data show a previously undetected main effect
of ratio direction.</p>
