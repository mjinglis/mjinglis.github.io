					<p><i>Abstract:</i> 
					The analysis of student-generated proofs and purported proofs has become an important part of mathematics education research. In this paper we argue that rather than concentrate on analysing only purported proofs, there are advantages to analysing student generated arguments of all kinds: those which reduce uncertainty in a conjecture, and those which remove uncertainty in a conjecture. In this paper we discuss the rationale for this approach and argue that adopting such a stance has both theoretical and methodological implications for mathematics education researchers. We particularly focus on what implications our perspective has for Tall's (2004) theory of three worlds of mathematics. </p>
